title: cd into a random directory in Linux.

I have a `music` directory with a lot of different subdirectories,
representing artists. Sometimes, selecting a random artist so
I don't have to pick one is convenient.

The following function was inspired from
[here](http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/8151/)
and is in my
[zshrc](https://github.com/bamos/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc),
but can also be used in a
[.bashrc](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/sample-bashrc.html),
or however else you prefer to use it.
It first obtains a list of directories (including hidden)
and gets the number of them to pass to
[xargs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs)
so the command isn't called multiple times for large argument lists.
(Note: This could break down for extremely large lists of directories.)
Then, [shuf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuf)
does all the work and selects a random directory from the list.

{% highlight bash %}
function rand-cd {
  DIRS=$(find . -maxdepth 1 -type d | sed 's/\(.*\)/"\1"/g')
  NUM_DIRS=$(echo $DIRS | wc -l)
  [[ $NUM_DIRS == 1 ]] && echo "Warning: No directories found."
  cd "$(echo $DIRS | xargs -n $NUM_DIRS shuf -n1 -e)"
  unset DIRS NUM_DIRS
}
{% endhighlight %}
