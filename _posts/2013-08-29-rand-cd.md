title: cd into a random directory in Linux.
tags: [Linux]

I have a `music` directory with a lot of different subdirectories,
representing artists. Sometimes, selecting a random artist so
I don't have to pick one is convenient.

The following function was inspired from
[here](http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/8151/)
and is in my
[zshrc](https://github.com/bamos/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc),
but can also be used in a
[.bashrc](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/sample-bashrc.html),
or however else you prefer to use it.
It selects a random directory and `cd`'s into it.

{% highlight bash %}
function rand-cd {
  FILES=$(find . -maxdepth 1 -type d | perl -lne 'print quotemeta')
  NUM_FILES=$(echo $FILES | wc -l)
  cd $(echo $FILES | xargs -n $NUM_FILES shuf -n1 -e)*
}
{% endhighlight %}
