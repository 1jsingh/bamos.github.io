Google's Picasa provides a great way of organizing and geotagging pictures.
However, there is currently no standard way of viewing the albums on a map.
[angryziber/picasa-gallery][picasa-gallery] provides a Java program
running on Google App Engine to provide this, but I wanted something
more lightweight in a familiar environment, so I created this project.

See the [demo][demo] and try it with your own Picasa account at
`http://picasa-map.herokuapp.com/<user>`.
While this acts exactly how I want it to,
do get in contact if you run into any issues.
