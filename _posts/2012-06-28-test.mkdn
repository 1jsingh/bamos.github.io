title: Merging OpenFOAM versions in git
tags: [OpenFOAM, git]
---

A question came up recently on this [forum
thread](http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam/70409-git-history-1-5-1-6-a.html)
about how to merge the separate change histories from different OpenFOAM
versions. The simplest solution is to merge with an `ours` strategy, which
I'll present directly.

Of course, you can also question why disconnected git histories exist in the
first place and immediately notice that the same type of issues will simply
re-occur with future OpenFOAM-1.7.x, OpenFOAM-1.8.x, *etc* releases. I'll
thus also take the opportunity to explain why I think the current OpenFOAM
development model is perhaps not as bad at it might first appear and might
indeed be the only practical development model at the moment.

---------------
### The quick solution

This is literally a *quick* solution if you are using exising local files.

The merge operations are safe to use within your normal OpenFOAM directories
(provided they are in a clean state), but it is also quite reasonable to use
a new temporary directory for the operations -- either for safety or just as
a sandpit to play around a bit. Using a new temporary directory also nicely
illustrates the distributed nature of git -- each repository being its own
centre of the universe.
