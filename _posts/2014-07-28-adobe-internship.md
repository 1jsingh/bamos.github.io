title: Life as a summer intern at Adobe Research.
tags: [News]

I've had a great experience interning with [Adobe Research][adobe-research]
in San Jose this summer and am writing this post to talk about my experiences.

## Brief Bio
I'm entering Carnegie Mellon's Computer Science PhD program in August
to study distributed and mobile systems.
I also strongly support open source software and
maintain an [active GitHub portfolio][bamos-github].
I balance my work between research and advanced development
to contribute to research theory and open source projects of my own.

I first heard about Adobe Research when I saw open source projects
on the [Adobe Research GitHub][adobe-research-github] last December.
The combination of research theory with open source technology made
me very interested in working with Adobe Research.
I emailed a prominent contributer to the projects regarding
summer internships and he said he was looking for interns.
After talking on the phone with him, he put me in contact
with the HR department and I officially signed on as an intern with him!

## Internship Project
Adobe provides marketing technology to process large amounts of data
using thousands of computers in synchrony, a *distributed system*.
Communication between thousands of computers is difficult and
the current solution Adobe uses might not be the most efficient
use of the computers.
My summer project has been to explore open source research
technology and come up with techniques to compare different
techniques of programming the distributed system for Adobe's needs.

My day-to-day work revolves around Adobe's internal GitHub's issue tracker,
which lets me and my manager quickly keep track, discuss, and prioritize
my tasks.
For example, one of my tasks could be to create a performance measure
of the distributed system and plot how the system is performing.
Once implementing this, I'll attach the code and plot to the issue
and ask my manager to take a look at it.

Concluding my summer, we're planning to contribute a few small
open source projects of the technology I've been working on
and are considering writing a short technical report on my findings.

## Summary
My summer with Adobe Research has been fantastic and
I hope to have another opportunity to collaborate
with the group in the future!
