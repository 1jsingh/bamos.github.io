title: Concluding Snowplow's Winter of Code
tags: [News]
---

[Snowplow Analytics][snowplow] is a London-based startup
providing an [open-source][snowplow-github] analytics platform and held
a remote [winternship][snowplow-wintern] program for university students.
[I was happily selected][snowplow-intro] and just finished my projects.
I built on Snowplow's core platform in Scala with
[Spray][spray] and [Amazon Kinesis][kinesis], and
developed 3 new modules using these libraries.
See [this document][listings] ([src][listings-src]) for a snapshot
of what I build, and the repos for current code at
[snowplow/kinesis-example-scala-consumer][consumer],
[snowplow/kinesis-example-scala-producer][producer], and
[snowplow/snowplow][snowplow/snowplow].
I also had the idea to build [bamos/github-wiki-link-validator][validator]
while modifying the Wiki to check for broken internal links.

The remote winternship was very unique, for me as my first
remote work experience, and for Snowplow, being based in the UK and
trying out remote winternships with students from around the world.
From my perspective, the internship went smoothly,
and my workflow blended well with Snowplow's workflow:

1. File/Assign an issue
2. Comment and attach commits
3. Close the issue

Compared to the larger companies I've interned with,
the development here was much more rapid,
but there wasn't as much networking with other interns.
At large companies with hundreds of interns,
I met new interns almost daily.

All in all, though, the remote work was great and
I'm more keen to remote opportunities in the future!
