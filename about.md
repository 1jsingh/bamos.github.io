# About me.
I am a Computer Science undergraduate at [Virginia Tech][scholar]
interested in mobile computing, security, and compiler research.
I have ongoing research projects in
_malware analysis_ at runtime on _mobile systems_ using _machine learning_,
automatic _compiler systems_ on heterogeneous architectures,
and  _stochastic optimization_.
For more information, find my publications on
[Google Scholar][scholar] and see [my vitae][cv].

Furthermore, I enjoy contributing to the open-source community
and maintain as many projects as possible on my
[GitHub][github], including [this website][website]
which is published with [jekyll][jekyll]

If you'd like to contact me, please [email me][email],
and feel free to use [PGP][pgp].
Thanks!
