    Hi! I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at [Carnegie Mellon][cmu]
    and obtained a B.S. in Computer Science
    from [Virginia Tech][vt] in May 2014.
    I'm interested in distributed and mobile computing and am
    happy to be advised by [Satya][satya].
    For more information, find my publications on [Google Scholar][scholar],
    [my vitae][cv], and my [GitHub profile][github].
