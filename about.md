# About me.
I am a Computer Science undergraduate at [Virginia Tech](http://www.cs.vt.edu)
intersted in mobile computing, security, and compiler research.
I have ongoing research projects in
_malware analysis_ at runtime on _mobile systems_ using _machine learning_,
automatic _compiler systems_ on heterogeneous architectures,
and  _stochastic optimization_.
For more information, find my publications on
[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CZwrwHAAAAAJ)
and see
[my vitae](../cv).

Furthermore, I enjoy contributing to the open-source community
and maintain as many projects as possible on my
[GitHub](http://github.com/bamos),
including [this website](https://github.com/bamos/bamos.github.io),
which is published with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
