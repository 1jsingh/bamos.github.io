# Brandon Amos

Hi!
I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student
at Carnegie Mellon University, where
I work on machine learning,
mobile computing, and distributed systems.
I strive to make all of my work free,
open source, and reproducible.

You can contact me at [bamos@cs.cmu.edu](mailto:bamos@cs.cmu.edu).

# Research Projects

+ [Elijah](http://elijah.cs.cmu.edu/): Low-latency mobile applications
  that often involve real-time video or audio processing.
  For my PhD, I'm studying distributed algorithms to improve the
  performance of deep neural networks and
  integer/combinatorial optimization.
+ [Spindle](https://github.com/adobe-research/spindle):
  Web analytics processing with Scala, Spark, and Parquet,
  created as a summer intern at Adobe Research.
+ [Clasp](https://github.com/hamiltont/clasp):
  Large-scale Android emulator control on a distributed system.
+ **STREAM**:
  As an undergraduate, I applied of machine learning techniques to dynamic
  Android malware detection, which resulted in
  [this publication](http://bamos.github.io/data/papers/amos-iwcmc2013.pdf).
  The code is openly available
  [on GitHub](https://github.com/VT-Magnum-Research/antimalware).
+ **QNSTOP**:
  As an undergraduate, I also helped develop parallel versions of quasi-Newton
  stochastic optimization algorithms.
  A preprint of our early results are available as a tech
  report
  [here](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/49672/qnTOMS14.pdf).
  I applied these techniques to a systems biology problem in
  [this publication](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2685662).

# Fun Side Projects
+ [SnowGlobe](https://github.com/bamos/snowglobe):
  Haskell-driven, small-scale web analytics with minimal configuration.
+ [My reading list](http://bamos.github.io/reading-list/):
  YAML data and hosted on GitHub pages.
+ [dotfiles](https://github.com/bamos/dotfiles):
  &hearts;
  [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/),
  OSX,
  [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/),
  [xmonad](http://xmonad.org/),
  [i3](https://i3wm.org/),
  [vim](http://www.vim.org/),
  [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/),
  [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/),
  [mpv](http://mpv.io/),
  [cmus](https://cmus.github.io/).
+ [girl](https://github.com/bamos/girl):
  Scala program to find broken links in GitHub projects.
+ [zsh-history-analysis](https://github.com/bamos/zsh-history-analysis):
  Analyze shell usage patterns with Python and R.
+ [python-scripts](https://github.com/bamos/python-scripts):
  Short and fun Python scripts.
+ [This website](https://github.com/bamos/bamos.github.io):
  Built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages.
+ [cv](https://github.com/bamos/cv):
  Python-driven resume-curriculum vitae with Jinja templates.
+ [yaml-mailer](https://github.com/bamos/yaml-mailer):
  Email many people different messages.
+ [latex-templates](https://github.com/bamos/latex-templates)
  and [beamer-snippets](https://github.com/bamos/beamer-snippets):
  Personal collection and previewing of LaTeX and Beamer snippets.
  Admittedly, I now use Keynote for presentations.
