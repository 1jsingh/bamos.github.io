# Brandon Amos

I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student
at Carnegie Mellon University, where
I work on machine learning,
mobile computing, and distributed systems.
I strive to make all of my work free,
open source, and reproducible.

You can contact me at [bamos@cs.cmu.edu](mailto:bamos@cs.cmu.edu).

**I'm looking for motivated undergraduates at CMU who
are interested in doing research!**
