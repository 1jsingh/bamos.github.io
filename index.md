# Brandon Amos

Hi!
I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student
at Carnegie Mellon University, where
I work on machine learning,
mobile computing, and distributed systems
in the [Elijah](http://elijah.cs.cmu.edu/)
research group.
I strive to make all of my work free,
open source, and reproducible.

You can contact me at [bamos@cs.cmu.edu](mailto:bamos@cs.cmu.edu).

# Research Projects

+ I created **Spindle**
  as a summer intern at Adobe Research before starting my PhD,
  which is a web analytics engine built with Scala, Spark, and Parquet.
  The code is openly available
  [on GitHub](https://github.com/adobe-research/spindle).
+ **STREAM**:
  As an undergraduate, I applied of machine learning techniques to dynamic
  Android malware detection, which resulted in
  [this publication](http://bamos.github.io/data/papers/amos-iwcmc2013.pdf).
  The code is openly available
  [on GitHub](https://github.com/VT-Magnum-Research/antimalware).
+ **QNSTOP**:
  As an undergraduate, I also helped develop parallel versions of quasi-Newton
  stochastic optimization algorithms.
  A preprint of our early results are available as a tech
  report
  [here](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/49672/qnTOMS14.pdf).
  I helped apply QNSTOP and other optimization algorithms to a systems
  biology problem in
  [this publication](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2685662).
