# Brandon Amos

I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student
at Carnegie Mellon University, where
I work on machine learning,
mobile computing, and distributed systems.
I strive to make all of my work free,
open source, and reproducible.

You can contact me at [bamos@cs.cmu.edu](mailto:bamos@cs.cmu.edu).

  created [girl](https://github.com/bamos/girl)
  to help remove some broken links from GitHub.
+ I love using [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/),
  [xmonad](http://xmonad.org/), and other Linux-based tools.
  Check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/bamos/dotfiles).

  [zsh-history-analysis](https://github.com/bamos/zsh-history-analysis)
  to analyze my shell usage patterns.
+ [Short Python scripts](https://github.com/bamos/python-scripts)
